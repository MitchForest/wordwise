# AI Assistant Project Management Rules

## Quick Reference
This project uses a `.pm` directory to maintain unified memory across sessions. Follow these rules:

## Start of Session
1. **Always read** [.pm/PROJECT_STATUS.md](mdc:.pm/PROJECT_STATUS.md) first
2. **Check current sprint** file for context
3. **Review epic summary** if starting new work
4. **Review project management workflow** @.pm/pm_guide.md

## During Work
1. **Update sprint file** with progress in real-time
2. **Document decisions** as they're made
3. **Track all file changes** (created/modified/deleted)
4. **Ask before assuming** - clarify requirements

## Sprint Workflow
1. Read requirements → 2. Investigate code → 3. Ask questions → 4. Create plan → 5. Get approval → 6. Execute → 7. Test → 8. Document

## Testing Requirements
Before completing any sprint, **always run**:
- `bun lint` - Fix any linting errors
- `bun typecheck` - Resolve all TypeScript errors
- `bun run build` - Ensure project builds successfully

**Never run** `bun dev` - ask the user to run the dev server if needed for testing.

## File Updates Required
- **Sprint file**: Update task checkboxes, decisions, and session summary
- **PROJECT_STATUS.md**: Update current work and last modified date
- **Epic summary**: Update if sprint scope changes

## Documentation Format
```markdown
## Session Summary
**Completed:**
- Specific accomplishment

**Files Changed:**
- `created: path/to/file.ts`
- `modified: path/to/file.ts`

**Remaining:**
- Next tasks
```

## Key Paths
- Status: [.pm/PROJECT_STATUS.md](mdc:.pm/PROJECT_STATUS.md)
- Epics: [.pm/epics/](mdc:.pm/epics)
- Sprints: `.pm/epics/epic-XXX-name/sprint-XXX-feature.md`
- Docs: [.pm/docs/](mdc:.pm/docs)

**Remember**: The `.pm` directory is your persistent memory. Keep it updated!
