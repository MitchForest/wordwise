# WordWise Project Status

## Current Sprint
**Sprint**: 006 - WordPress Publishing MVP ✅ COMPLETED  
**Epic**: 001 - Local-First Analysis Refactor  
**Status**: Planning Architecture Transformation (Sprints 7-12)

## Recent Achievements

### Sprint 006 Completed ✅
- Implemented WordPress REST API integration
- Built secure credential encryption (user-specific keys)
- Created publishing UI with dialog and setup flow
- Started user settings system with tabbed interface
- Fixed duplicate suggestion keys with position-based IDs
- Resolved all editor layout and animation issues

### Architecture Decision
After analyzing persistent position-related bugs and preparing for Epic 2 (AI features), we've designed a comprehensive architecture transformation:

**New Event-Sourced Suggestion System**
- Suggestions as immutable events (not mutable state)
- Document version tracking with snapshots
- Multi-strategy position resolution
- Reactive streams with RxJS
- Layered analysis pipeline
- Progressive UI rendering

## Upcoming Sprints (7-12)

### Sprint 007: Document Version Tracking (1 week)
- Implement DocumentSnapshot system
- Build version manager with checksums
- Add IndexedDB storage

### Sprint 008: Suggestion Events Architecture (1.5 weeks)
- Transform suggestions to immutable events
- Implement position resolution strategies
- Build migration adapters

### Sprint 009: Reactive Streams (1 week)
- Implement RxJS-based state management
- Build optimistic update system
- Create stream-based UI components

### Sprint 010: Layered Analysis Pipeline (1.5 weeks)
- Create flexible analyzer system
- Support concurrent/sequential execution
- Add caching and retry logic

### Sprint 011: UI Performance (1 week)
- Implement virtual scrolling
- Optimize animations
- Add progressive rendering

### Sprint 012: Migration & Rollout (2 weeks)
- Feature flag system
- Gradual rollout strategy
- Monitoring and rollback capability

## Technical Decisions

1. **Why Event Sourcing?**: Current position-based system breaks when document changes. Events with version tracking ensure suggestions remain valid.

2. **Why RxJS?**: Complex state management with multiple analysis tiers requires reactive programming for efficiency.

3. **Why Now?**: Before adding AI features (Epic 2), we need a robust foundation that can handle async operations and complex state.

## Next Actions
1. Begin Sprint 007 implementation
2. Set up RxJS and required dependencies
3. Create detailed technical design docs
4. Prepare migration strategy

## Risk Mitigation
- Parallel system operation during migration
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Comprehensive testing at each phase
- Ability to rollback at any point

## Project Health
- **Code Quality**: Good (linting/type checks passing)
- **Performance**: Good (but will improve significantly)
- **Architecture**: Transitioning to excellent
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive sprint plans created
