# WordWise Project Status

## Current Sprint
**Sprint**: Planning Epic 1.5 - Pragmatic Architecture Improvements
**Epic**: 001.5 - Pragmatic Architecture Improvements  
**Status**: Epic and Sprint files created, ready for implementation

## Recent Achievements

### Epic 1.5 Planning Completed ✅
- Created epic folder structure following PM guide
- Generated 4 focused sprint files (007-010)
- Pivoted from complex event-sourcing to pragmatic text-based approach
- Reduced timeline from 8.5 weeks to 4 weeks

### Sprint 006 Completed ✅
- Implemented WordPress REST API integration
- Built secure credential encryption (user-specific keys)
- Created publishing UI with dialog and setup flow
- Started user settings system with tabbed interface
- Fixed duplicate suggestion keys with position-based IDs
- Resolved all editor layout and animation issues

### Architecture Decision Update
After reviewing the original Sprint 7-12 event-sourcing plan, adopted a more pragmatic approach based on industry best practices:

**New Text-Based Suggestion System**
- Text-based matching (not position-based)
- Incremental analysis (10x performance gain)
- Smart responsiveness with dynamic debouncing
- Clean architecture ready for AI integration
- Ships in 4 weeks instead of 8.5 weeks

## Upcoming Sprints (Epic 1.5)

### Sprint 007: Text-Based Suggestions (1 week)
- Fix position bug permanently with text-based matching
- Implement fuzzy text finding algorithm
- Add automatic suggestion cleanup
- Create backward compatibility adapter

### Sprint 008: Incremental Analysis System (1 week)
- Only analyze changed paragraphs
- Implement smart caching layer
- Build clean analyzer pipeline
- Add performance monitoring

### Sprint 009: Smart Responsiveness (1 week)
- Dynamic debouncing based on edit type
- Client-side pre-filtering
- Suggestion relevance scoring
- Progressive enhancement for slow connections

### Sprint 010: Performance & Polish (1 week)
- Virtual scrolling for 500+ suggestions
- Web Worker for text search
- Feature flag system
- Migration and monitoring

## Technical Decisions

1. **Why Text-Based?**: Position-based suggestions break when document changes. Text is the invariant - track WHAT is wrong, not WHERE.

2. **Why Incremental Analysis?**: Analyzing entire documents is wasteful. Only process what changed for 10x performance.

3. **Why This Approach?**: Simpler, proven patterns used by Grammarly. Lower risk, faster delivery, better user experience.

## Next Actions
1. Review and approve Epic 1.5 plan
2. Begin Sprint 007 implementation
3. Set up performance monitoring baseline
4. Prepare feature flag infrastructure

## Risk Mitigation
- Each sprint delivers user value
- Feature flags for safe rollout
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Simple, debuggable architecture

## Project Health
- **Code Quality**: Good (linting/type checks passing)
- **Performance**: Current issues, but clear path to 10x improvement
- **Architecture**: Transitioning to pragmatic, proven patterns
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive epic and sprint plans created
