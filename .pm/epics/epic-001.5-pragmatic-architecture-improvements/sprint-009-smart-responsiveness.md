# Sprint 009: Smart Responsiveness

**Status:** Planning
**Epic:** 001.5 - Pragmatic Architecture Improvements
**Date Started:** TBD
**Date Completed:** TBD

## Feature Requirements
Make the system feel intelligent and instant by implementing dynamic debouncing based on edit type, client-side pre-filtering to reduce API calls, suggestion relevance scoring, and progressive enhancement for slow connections. The goal is perceived instant response with intelligent prioritization of suggestions.

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement dynamic debouncing based on edit type
- [ ] Add edit type detection (paste, deletion, typing, undo/redo)
- [ ] Create client-side pre-filtering for common patterns
- [ ] Build local spell check cache
- [ ] Implement suggestion relevance scoring algorithm
- [ ] Add error severity weighting system
- [ ] Create position importance scoring (title > body)
- [ ] Implement user preference learning (basic)
- [ ] Add top-N filtering for suggestions panel
- [ ] Create progressive enhancement system
- [ ] Add timeout handling for slow connections
- [ ] Implement partial results display
- [ ] Add performance metrics tracking
- [ ] Write tests for responsiveness features

## Technical Plan

### 1. Dynamic Debouncing System
```typescript
interface EditTypeDebounce {
  paste: 100,      // Near instant for large changes
  deletion: 200,   // Quick for removals
  typing: 400,     // Standard for normal typing
  undo: 0,         // Instant for undo/redo
  bulkEdit: 50     // Very fast for programmatic changes
}

function getDebounceTime(editType: EditType): number {
  return EditTypeDebounce[editType];
}
```

### 2. Client-Side Pre-Filtering
```typescript
interface PreFilter {
  skipPatterns: RegExp[]; // URLs, emails, numbers
  localSpellCache: Map<string, boolean>;
  recentlyChecked: LRUCache<string, SuggestionResult>;
  
  shouldSkip(text: string): boolean;
  getCached(text: string): SuggestionResult | null;
}
```

### 3. Relevance Scoring
```typescript
interface RelevanceScore {
  severity: number;      // 0-1 (error > warning > info)
  position: number;      // 0-1 (title > headers > body)
  frequency: number;     // 0-1 (common errors score higher)
  userHistory: number;   // 0-1 (based on past interactions)
  
  calculate(): number;   // Combined score 0-100
}
```

### 4. Progressive Enhancement
- Show cached results immediately
- Display "analyzing..." indicator for pending
- Stream results as they arrive
- Fallback UI for offline mode
- Graceful degradation for slow connections

## Files to Modify
- `hooks/useUnifiedAnalysis.ts` - Add dynamic debouncing logic
- `lib/editor/edit-type-detector.ts` - Create edit type detection
- `services/analysis/pre-filter.ts` - Implement client-side filtering
- `services/analysis/relevance-scorer.ts` - Create scoring system
- `components/panels/EnhancedSuggestionsPanel.tsx` - Add relevance sorting
- `lib/editor/local-spell-cache.ts` - Implement spell check cache
- `hooks/useDebounce.ts` - Update for dynamic debouncing
- `contexts/SuggestionContext.tsx` - Add progressive loading

## Decisions & Notes
- Edit type detection based on operation size and type
- Local spell cache uses browser storage for persistence
- Relevance scoring weights can be adjusted based on user feedback
- Progressive enhancement ensures usability on all connection speeds
