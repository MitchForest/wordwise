# Epic 001.5: Pragmatic Architecture Improvements

## Description
After analyzing the current WordWise architecture and the proposed Sprint 7-12 plans, this epic implements a streamlined approach that solves core issues while preparing for AI integration. This epic focuses on fixing the fundamental position-based suggestion bug by switching to text-based matching, implementing incremental analysis for 10x performance gains, and creating a clean architecture ready for AI enhancements.

## Planned Sprints
1. **Sprint 007:** Text-Based Suggestions - Fix the position bug permanently with text-based matching
2. **Sprint 008:** Incremental Analysis System - Only analyze what changed for 10x performance gain
3. **Sprint 009:** Smart Responsiveness - Make the system feel intelligent and instant
4. **Sprint 010:** Performance & Polish - Handle documents with 500+ suggestions smoothly

## Technical Approach
- **Text is the invariant**: Track WHAT text is problematic, not WHERE it is
- **Incremental analysis**: Only re-analyze changed paragraphs, not entire documents
- **Smart caching**: Reuse results for unchanged content
- **Clean pipeline architecture**: Simple, extensible analyzer registration for future AI integration
- **Progressive enhancement**: Local checks first, then remote AI

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Zero position errors after edits (text-based matching works)
- [ ] 80% reduction in analysis work on typical edits
- [ ] Sub-100ms response for single word changes
- [ ] Smooth performance with 1000+ suggestions (60fps)
- [ ] < 50MB memory usage for large documents
- [ ] Clean API ready for AI analyzers
- [ ] Successful migration of all users without disruption

## Key Benefits
- **Ships in 4 weeks** instead of original 8.5 week plan
- **Each sprint delivers visible improvements** to users
- **Lower risk** with incremental changes
- **10x performance improvement** measured, not theoretical
- **AI-ready architecture** without over-engineering
