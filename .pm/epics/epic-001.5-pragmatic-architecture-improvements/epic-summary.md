# Epic 001.5: Pragmatic Architecture Improvements

## Description
After analyzing the current WordWise architecture and the proposed Sprint 7-12 plans, this epic implements a streamlined approach that solves core issues while preparing for AI integration. This epic focuses on fixing the fundamental position-based suggestion bug by switching to text-based matching, implementing incremental analysis for 10x performance gains, and creating a clean architecture ready for AI enhancements.

## Planned Sprints
1. **Sprint 007:** Position-Independent Suggestions - Fix the position bug permanently with ProseMirror tracking (COMPLETE)
2. **Sprint 008:** Essential Optimizations - Add caching and virtual scrolling for better performance

## Technical Approach
- **Position-independent IDs**: Stable identification that survives edits
- **ProseMirror position tracking**: Leverage built-in transaction mapping
- **Simple caching**: Reuse analysis results for unchanged content
- **Virtual scrolling**: Handle large suggestion lists efficiently
- **Progressive enhancement**: Local checks first, then remote AI

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Zero position errors after edits (text-based matching works)
- [ ] 80% reduction in analysis work on typical edits
- [ ] Sub-100ms response for single word changes
- [ ] Smooth performance with 1000+ suggestions (60fps)
- [ ] < 50MB memory usage for large documents
- [ ] Clean API ready for AI analyzers
- [ ] Successful migration of all users without disruption

## Key Benefits
- **Ships in 1 week** instead of original 8.5 week plan
- **Focused on high-impact improvements** that users will notice
- **Lower risk** with minimal changes
- **Better performance** through caching and virtual scrolling
- **AI-ready architecture** without over-engineering 

## Sprint Breakdown

### Sprint 007: Text-Based Suggestions (1 week) âœ… COMPLETE
**Goal:** Fix position bug permanently by converting to text-based matching

**Key Features:**
- Convert from position-based to text-based suggestion tracking
- Implement exact string matching with occurrence counting
- Add automatic suggestion cleanup when text deleted
- Use content-based IDs (djb2 hash) for stability

**Success Metrics:**
- Zero position-related console errors
- Suggestions survive document edits
- Performance: <5ms position lookup

**Status:** Complete - All features implemented, race conditions fixed, tests passing

### Sprint 008: Essential Optimizations (3 days)
**Goal:** Implement high-impact, low-complexity improvements

**Key Features:**
- Add caching to fast analysis endpoint (5 minute TTL)
- Implement virtual scrolling for 500+ suggestions
- Test performance with large documents

**Success Metrics:**
- Cache hit rate > 50% for typical editing
- Smooth 60fps scrolling with 1000+ suggestions
- < 50MB memory usage

**Status:** Planning - Ready to implement
