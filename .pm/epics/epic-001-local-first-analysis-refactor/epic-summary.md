- Add caching and retry logic
- Build progressive result delivery

### Sprint 011: UI Performance Optimization (1 week)
**Goal**: Optimize UI for smooth performance with hundreds of suggestions
- Implement virtual scrolling
- Add component memoization
- Optimize animations with CSS transforms
- Create progressive rendering

### Sprint 012: Migration and Rollout (2 weeks)
**Goal**: Safely migrate to new architecture with zero downtime
- Build feature flag system
- Create adapter layer
- Implement gradual rollout
- Add monitoring and rollback

## Technical Achievements

### Current Architecture
- **Event-Driven Analysis**: Different checks trigger at optimal times
- **Essence-Based IDs**: Suggestions remain stable across edits
- **Reconciliation Window**: Prevents UI bouncing during updates
- **Local-First Performance**: Sub-second response times

### New Architecture (Sprints 7-12)
- **Event-Sourced Suggestions**: Immutable events with version tracking
- **Position Independence**: Suggestions survive document changes
- **Reactive Streams**: Efficient state management with RxJS
- **Layered Pipeline**: Flexible analyzer registration
- **AI-Ready**: Foundation for Epic 2's AI enhancements

## Success Metrics

### Achieved
- ✅ Real-time spell checking (< 100ms)
- ✅ Fast analysis tier (< 500ms)
- ✅ Stable suggestion system
- ✅ WordPress publishing capability
- ✅ 95%+ suggestion accuracy

### Target (Post-Migration)
- Zero position errors
- 60fps UI performance
- < 50MB memory usage
- 95%+ position resolution rate
- Seamless AI integration capability

## Key Decisions

1. **Event-Sourced Architecture**: Suggestions as immutable events rather than mutable state
2. **Multi-Strategy Positions**: Multiple fallback strategies for position resolution
3. **Reactive Streams**: RxJS for complex state management
4. **Gradual Migration**: Feature flags and parallel systems for safe rollout
5. **AI Foundation**: Architecture designed for future AI enhancement

## Dependencies

### Completed
- nspell (spell checking)
- write-good (style analysis)
- text-statistics (readability)
- WordPress REST API

### Upcoming
- RxJS (reactive streams)
- LRU Cache (performance)
- IndexedDB (snapshot storage)

## Risks & Mitigations

### Technical Risks
- **Migration Complexity**: Mitigated by adapter pattern and gradual rollout
- **Performance Overhead**: Mitigated by aggressive caching and virtualization
- **Learning Curve**: Mitigated by comprehensive documentation

### Resolved Issues
- ✅ Duplicate React keys (context-aware IDs)
- ✅ UI bouncing (reconciliation window)
- ✅ Position errors (upcoming: event sourcing)

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Sprints 7-12**: Build new architecture
2. **Migration**: Safely transition all users
3. **Epic 2 Preparation**: Enable AI features
4. **Performance Optimization**: Based on real usage

## Documentation

### Updated
- Canonical assistant architecture
- Sprint documentation
- API integration guides

### Needed
- Migration guide
- RxJS patterns guide
- Performance tuning guide

## Team Notes

The architecture transformation in sprints 7-12 is critical for long-term success. While it requires significant effort, it positions WordWise to handle:
- Complex AI-powered suggestions
- Large documents with hundreds of suggestions
- Real-time collaboration (future)
- Plugin ecosystem (future)

The investment in proper architecture now will pay dividends as we scale the product and add more sophisticated features.
