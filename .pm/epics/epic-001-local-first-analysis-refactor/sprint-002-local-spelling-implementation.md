# Sprint 002: Local Spelling Implementation

**Status:** Complete
**Epic:** 001 - Local-First Analysis Refactor
**Date Started:** 2024-05-23
**Date Completed:** 2024-05-23

## Feature Requirements
As a user, when I type a misspelled word, it should be underlined in the editor, and I should see actionable suggestions in the side panel.

## Tasks
- [x] Create a `SpellCheckerService` singleton to manage the `nspell` instance.
- [x] Ensure the service is initialized only on the client-side to avoid SSR issues.
- [x] Integrate the `SpellCheckerService` into our `UnifiedAnalysisEngine`.
- [x] Implement the `runSpellCheck` method within the engine to find misspellings.
- [x] Traverse the document node tree to get accurate positions for each misspelling.
- [x] The `useUnifiedAnalysis` hook calls the engine and updates the `SuggestionContext`.
- [x] The `EnhancedSuggestionsPanel` displays suggestions with "Apply" and "Ignore" buttons.
- [x] The `BlogEditor` applies wavy-red-underline decorations for spelling errors.
- [x] Fix critical bug where applying a suggestion used the wrong coordinates.
- [x] Test the full flow by typing "My nme is Mitchell. Wat is your name? The hoouse is big." and confirming correct behavior.

## Technical Plan
The implementation followed the `Hook -> Context -> UI` pattern established in Sprint 001. A major challenge was a persistent Webpack build error caused by the `dictionary-en` package attempting to use Node.js `fs` module on the client. After multiple failed attempts to fix this with dynamic imports, the solution was to bypass Webpack entirely by `fetch`ing the dictionary files from a CDN at runtime. Another critical bug was discovered where text replacements were happening at incorrect locations; this was resolved by switching from a simple text search to a `doc.descendants` tree traversal to get precise coordinates and using the atomic `insertContentAt` TipTap command.

## Files to Modify
- `created: services/analysis/spellcheck.ts`
- `modified: services/analysis/engine.ts`
- `modified: hooks/useUnifiedAnalysis.ts`
- `modified: contexts/SuggestionContext.tsx`
- `modified: components/editor/BlogEditor.tsx`
- `modified: components/panels/EnhancedSuggestionsPanel.tsx`
- `modified: components/editor/EditorStatusBar.tsx`
- `modified: components/tiptap-templates/simple/simple-editor.scss`
- `modified: services/analysis/index.ts`

## Decisions & Notes
- **`dictionary-en` is incompatible with Webpack/Next.js client-side.** The package pulls in `fs` regardless of dynamic import strategies. The final solution was to fetch the dictionary files directly from the `unpkg` CDN. This is a crucial workaround.
- **Text replacement must be atomic.** Using separate `deleteRange` and `insertContent` commands is unreliable. The `insertContentAt` command, which takes a range object, is the correct, robust solution.
- **The analysis engine needs the full document object.** Passing just `textContent` is insufficient for getting accurate positions. The engine must receive the TipTap `doc` node and use `doc.descendants` to find errors in their proper context.

## Session Summary
**Completed:**
- The entire local spell-check feature is complete and functional.
- Errors are underlined in the editor.
- Suggestions are displayed in the side panel with actionable buttons.
- A critical bug with applying suggestions has been fixed.
- The status bar now correctly reflects the number of spelling errors.

**Remaining:**
- None for this sprint.
