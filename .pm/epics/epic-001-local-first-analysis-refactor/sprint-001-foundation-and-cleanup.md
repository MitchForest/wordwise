# Sprint 1: Foundation & Cleanup

**Feature:** Refactor the codebase to establish a new, simplified foundation for the analysis engine, removing the old, complex data flow.

---

### Plan

1.  [x] Purge old code, including `hooks/useOptimizedAnalysis.ts` and the temporary spell-check client.
2.  [x] Refactor `RightPanel.tsx` and `BlogEditor.tsx` to remove the old suggestion-passing logic.
3.  [x] Create a new, clean `contexts/SuggestionContext.tsx` to act as the central state for all suggestions.
4.  [x] Create the skeleton for the new analysis service in `services/analysis/engine.ts`.
5.  [x] Create the skeleton for the new unified hook in `hooks/useUnifiedAnalysis.ts`.
6.  [x] Wire up the new `useUnifiedAnalysis` hook in `BlogEditor.tsx`.
7.  [x] Perform a full codebase quality check (`lint`, `typecheck`, `build`) and fix any resulting errors.

### Session Summary

*   **What was completed:** We successfully completed all steps of the plan. The old, brittle data flow was removed, and a new foundation (`useUnifiedAnalysis` -> `SuggestionContext` -> UI) is now in place. All linting, type, and build errors were resolved.
*   **Decisions Made:** We confirmed the `Hook -> Context -> UI` pattern is the correct architectural direction. We decided to press on despite a persistent, non-blocking linter error with `use-debounce`, suspecting a toolchain issue.
*   **Files Created/Modified:**
    *   `deleted: hooks/useOptimizedAnalysis.ts`
