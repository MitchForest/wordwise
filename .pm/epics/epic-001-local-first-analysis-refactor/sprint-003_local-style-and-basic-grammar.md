# Sprint 003: Local Analysis & Interactive UX

**Status:** âœ… Completed
**Epic:** 001 - Local-First Analysis Refactor
**Date Started:** 2024-05-24
**Date Completed:** 2024-05-25

## Goal
The goal of this sprint was to expand local-first analysis to include style and basic grammar checks, and to build a rich, interactive user experience for viewing and acting on suggestions. This involved refactoring the analysis engine, implementing new analysis services, and then building the UI/UX to support features like color-coded suggestions, hover-to-highlight interactivity, and a robust side panel.

## Completed Work

- **Phase 1: Backend Analysis Engine**
    - [x] **Engine Refactor:** The `UnifiedAnalysisEngine` in `services/analysis/engine.ts` has been successfully refactored to support a tiered architecture (`runInstantChecks`, `runFastChecks`).
    - [x] **Dependency Installation:** The `write-good` library and its types have been added to the project.
    - [x] **Style Service:** A `StyleAnalyzer` using `write-good` has been implemented in `services/analysis/style.ts` and integrated into the `fastChecks` tier.
    - [x] **Grammar Service:** A `BasicGrammarChecker` with a rule for repeated words has been implemented in `services/analysis/basic-grammar.ts` and integrated into the `fastChecks` tier.
    - [x] **Hook Integration:** The `useUnifiedAnalysis` hook has been updated to call the new tiered engine methods with appropriate debouncing, feeding suggestions into the `SuggestionContext`.

- **Phase 2: Initial UI/UX Fixes**
    - [x] **Scrolling Panel:** The suggestions panel (`EnhancedSuggestionsPanel.tsx`) now uses a `<ScrollArea>` component, fixing the vertical scrolling issue.
    - [x] **Underline Foundation:** The Tiptap extension `EnhancedGrammarDecoration.tsx` now correctly assigns CSS classes based on both suggestion `category` (e.g., `grammar-spelling`) and `severity` (e.g., `grammar-error`).

- **Phase 3: Enhance UI Visuals & Feedback**
    - [x] **Color-Coded Underlines:**
        - In `app/globals.css`, created distinct underline color styles for `.grammar-spelling`, `.grammar-grammar`, and `.grammar-style` classes.
    - [x] **Color-Coded Badges:**
        - In `EnhancedSuggestionsPanel.tsx`, replaced the plain text category display with the `Badge` component.
        - Added color variants to the `Badge` component that correspond to suggestion categories.
    - [x] **Suggestion De-duplication:**
        - In `services/analysis/engine.ts`, added logic to filter out duplicate or overlapping suggestions.

- **Phase 4: Implement Interactive Highlighting**
    - [x] **Lift Editor State:**
        - In `app/doc/[id]/page.tsx`, initialized the Tiptap `useEditor` hook.
        - Passed the `editor` instance down to the `BlogEditor` and `RightPanel`.
    - [x] **Create Shared Hover State:**
        - In `contexts/SuggestionContext.tsx`, added state for `activeSuggestionId`.
    - [x] **Connect Editor and Panel to Shared State:**
        - Added event handlers to decorations in `EnhancedGrammarDecoration.tsx`.
        - Added event handlers to cards in `EnhancedSuggestionsPanel.tsx`.
        - Conditionally applied highlight styles based on `activeSuggestionId`.
    - [x] **Implement Auto-Scrolling:**
        - Implemented `useEffect` in `EnhancedSuggestionsPanel.tsx` to `scrollIntoView` when `activeSuggestionId` changes.

## Final Summary
This sprint successfully transitioned the analysis engine to a local-first model and built a sophisticated, interactive UI for displaying suggestions. The backend was extended with style and basic grammar checkers. The frontend received significant updates, including colored underlines, badges, and a fully interactive hover-to-highlight and auto-scrolling experience between the editor and the suggestions panel. The architectural change to lift the editor's state was critical and now enables much deeper integration between components. The project is now well-positioned for the final UI polish and metric integration in the next sprint.
