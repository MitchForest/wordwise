# Epic 002: Advanced Analysis & Progressive Enhancement

## Goal

The goal of this epic is to layer powerful, "deep" analysis capabilities on top of our stable local-first foundation. This will be done as a progressive enhancement, ensuring the application remains fast, responsive, and fully functional even if API services are unavailable.

By the end of this epic, WordWise will be enhanced with:
- **Advanced Grammar Checking:** Integration with the LanguageTool API to catch complex errors that local-only tools miss.
- **SEO Analysis Tools:** A dedicated service to provide writers with actionable feedback on how to optimize their content for search engines.

All new features will adhere to our established principles of graceful degradation and one-way data flow, solidifying WordWise as both a powerful and resilient writing assistant.
